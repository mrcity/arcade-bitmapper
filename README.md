# bitmaps.py

Converts 8-bit bitmaps into the encoding used by various 1980s arcade machines, and implants the converted data directly into the ROM files at the specified address(es).

See the code and example data files to get the idea of how to use the program.

NOTE: It is up to you to figure out which background tiles you want to overwrite by studying background tile addresses in MAME.  Then, it is up to you to rearrange the background tiles in the game, if necessary, by editing the appropriate program ROMs.  More details on the process can be found at: https://www.slideshare.net/StephenWylie3/process-of-arcade-rom-hacking
